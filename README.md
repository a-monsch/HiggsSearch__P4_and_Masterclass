# HiggsSearch Masterclass (pupils and/or students)

## Brief overview
This is a collection of materials that can be used as a template for
tasks that can be worked on in the master class ( or even over several
days) by pupils or by students (the more advanced version). The
sections are factorized and can be adapted and extended according to
the students' level of knowledge. Motivation for this collection is
the discovery of the Higgs Bosons in 2012, therefore the published
[data collections from the CMS detector](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/5500) [[1]](#1)
from 2012 (8 TeV data set) and the publication of the
[13 TeV data sets from Atlas](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/15005) [[2]](#2)
are used.The aim of this introduction is to give the students a
transparent overview of the discovery of the Higgs boson in the four
lepton channel and to motivate the statistical reasoning about the
actual discovery with the help of Python, that is also fundamentally
presented.
